# Interactive360
Custom version of Unity interactive 360 example for use with monoscopic 360 content for VR.

Based on Unity's own example code:

Changes include:
  - Additive loading of scenes to prevent delays when transitioning
  - Users can work on a scene and link scenes together more easily, without having to jump around
  - Support for 360 photos with PhotoSpheres
  - VideoPlayer preview controls for easy hotspot placement

Future work:
  - Clean up the currently hacky implementation
  - Add support for animation / sound cues from hotspot interactions
